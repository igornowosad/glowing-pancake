## What could be done better / omitted by purpose
- More tests - I've could make more tests, it's not a problem for me, but I did not want to take more time than 
  it's necessary for this kind of project. Those could be tests like "Happy path", or some tests regarding store.
- I've could make some facade for store to make it more flexible to changes
- Better design - but it wasn't in requirements ;)
- Error catch and loading for "Edit user" view
